        I really enjoy coumputer stuff, building, deploy app and maintain them.
        I love FOSS projects. Opensource bring me on software developement. My
        interest in software development started back in 2014 when I install
        Linux distro (Ubuntu) on my couputer, I decided to learn python to
        create script that auto removed files in bin after days i defined!
